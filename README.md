Smart Hydroponic Growth Detection System - Independent Research Project
This project automates plant monitoring and lighting control for a small-scale hydroponic system. Using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and sensors, the system identifies the growth stage of basil plants and adjusts the environment accordingly.

---

## Project Objectives

- Automate the process of determining basil plant growth stages using computer vision.
- Adjust LED lighting based on plant growth phase (seedling, vegetative, flowering).
- Monitor and log temperature, humidity, and ambient light conditions.
- Store daily image and sensor logs for long-term tracking.

## Problem Description

Manually monitoring plant growth and adjusting environmental conditions in a hydroponic setup is inefficient. This project addresses the challenge of automating that process using Python.

---

## Related Work

Many indoor farming projects use timers or basic environmental sensors. This project draws inspiration from:
- [PlantCV](https://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/) for plant image analysis.
- DIY Arduino/Raspberry Pi grow box automations.
- Visual analytics dashboards that track environmental trends.

---

## Solution

This project combines multiple Python libraries and modules to control and monitor the hydroponic setup:

## Features:
- Daily photo taken using the Pi Camera with a white-light flash.
- Growth stage detection using OpenCV (green pixel ratio).
- Automatic adjustment of RGB LEDs based on growth stage.
- Temperature and humidity readings using DHT22.
- Ambient light readings using LTR-329 sensor.
- Daily logs saved for sensor data and plant analysis results.

## Methodology:
- **Color Distribution Analysis** ‚Äì Detect green coverage to infer growth stage.
- **Time Series Logging** ‚Äì Monitor and record sensor data over time.
- **Multivariate Decision Logic** ‚Äì Combine sensor data and image analysis to decide LED profile.
